# Send to Kitchen Test Guide

## Testing the Fixed OrderService

### What We Fixed
1. **Safe notifyListeners()**: All `notifyListeners()` calls now use `SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback()` to prevent crashes during widget build cycles
2. **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks around all notification calls
3. **Memory Management**: Limited completed orders in memory to 100 to prevent memory issues
4. **Validation**: Added order validation before saving

### Expected Behavior
The app should now:
1. **NOT crash** after saving orders
2. Successfully send orders to kitchen
3. Show proper loading states and success messages
4. Navigate correctly after completion

### Test Steps

1. **Start the App**
   - Run `flutter run -d macos`
   - App should start without crashing
   - Look for: `flutter: Database opened successfully` and `flutter: App initialization completed`

2. **Create a Test Order**
   - Click "Continue as Admin"
   - Click "New Order"
   - Select "Dine In" 
   - Choose any table
   - Add some menu items to the order
   - Fill in customer details if needed

3. **Test Send to Kitchen**
   - Click "Send to Kitchen" button
   - **Expected logs**:
     ```
     flutter: Order saved successfully: DI-XXXXX
     ```
   - **App should NOT crash** after this log
   - **App should remain responsive**

4. **Verify Success**
   - Success message should appear
   - App should navigate back to order selection
   - No "Lost connection to device" message
   - App continues running normally

### Debug Information
If issues persist, look for these new debug messages:
- `Error notifying listeners: ...`
- `Error scheduling notification: ...`
- `Invalid order data: missing required fields`

### Success Criteria
✅ App doesn't crash after "Order saved successfully" message  
✅ Send to kitchen functionality works completely  
✅ Proper navigation after completion  
✅ No "Lost connection to device" errors

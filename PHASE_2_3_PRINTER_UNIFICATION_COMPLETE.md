}
```

## Phase 3 Integration ‚úÖ

### 1. Navigation Unification

**Single Printer Entry Point:**
- Updated `admin_panel_screen.dart` to use `UnifiedPrinterDashboard`
- Modified `universal_navigation.dart` for consistent routing
- Replaced all printer navigation references

**Navigation Changes:**
```dart
// Before: Multiple printer screens
PrinterSelectionScreen()
PrinterAssignmentScreen()
MultiPrinterConnectionWizard()
PrinterConfigurationScreen()

// After: Single unified interface
UnifiedPrinterDashboard()
```

### 2. Redundant Screen Removal

**Deleted Files:**
- ‚ùå `printer_selection_screen.dart` (304 lines)
- ‚ùå `printer_assignment_screen.dart` (1,200+ lines)
- ‚ùå `multi_printer_connection_wizard.dart` (500+ lines)

**Code Reduction:**
- **Total Lines Removed**: ~2,000+ lines
- **Complexity Reduction**: 75% fewer printer-related screens
- **Maintenance Burden**: Eliminated duplicate functionality

### 3. Import and Reference Updates

**Updated Files:**
- `lib/screens/admin_panel_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/checkout_screen.dart`
- `lib/widgets/universal_navigation.dart`

**Dependencies Added:**
- `http` package for cloud synchronization
- Enhanced error handling throughout the system

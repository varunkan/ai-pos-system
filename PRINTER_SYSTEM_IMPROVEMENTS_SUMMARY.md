## üéØ NEXT PHASE REQUIREMENTS

### **Phase 2: Implement Unified System**

#### 1. **Create Unified Printer Service** 
Create: `lib/services/unified_printer_service.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Global persistent assignments (cloud sync)
  - Real-time printer discovery & health monitoring
  - Enhanced receipt formatting (3x font, proper indentation)
  - Drag & drop assignment management
  - Multi-printer sequential processing
  - Automatic failover and retry mechanisms

#### 2. **Create Unified Dashboard**
Create: `lib/screens/unified_printer_dashboard.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Tab 1: Printers (Discovery, Status, Health)
  - Tab 2: Assignments (Drag & Drop Interface)
  - Tab 3: Configuration (Enhanced Settings)
  - Tab 4: Analytics (Performance Metrics)

#### 3. **Enhanced Receipt Formatting**
Implement 3x bigger font with perfect indentation:
```
KITCHEN ORDER (3x font)
Order #12345 (2x font)
=====================================
Date: 15/12/2024 14:30
Customer: John Doe
Table: 5
Server: Sarah
=====================================

2x BUTTER CHICKEN (2x font)
    ** SPECIAL: Extra spicy **
    CHEF NOTE: Customer allergic to nuts
    - Basmati Rice
    + Extra Naan
```

#### 4. **Drag & Drop Assignment Interface**
Visual interface with:
- Categories/Items list on left
- Printer targets on right
- Real-time drag & drop assignment
- Multi-printer support per item
- Assignment persistence across networks

### **Phase 3: Global Cloud Persistence**

#### 1. **Cloud API Integration**
Implement endpoints:
```
POST /api/restaurants/{id}/printers
GET  /api/restaurants/{id}/printers
POST /api/restaurants/{id}/assignments
GET  /api/restaurants/{id}/assignments
PUT  /api/restaurants/{id}/sync
```

#### 2. **Real-time Synchronization**
- Assignment changes sync immediately
- Full sync every 5 minutes
- Offline-first with sync queue
- Conflict resolution with timestamps

#### 3. **Global Network Access**
- Restaurant ID-based isolation
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Authentication tokens for security
- Backup and restore capabilities

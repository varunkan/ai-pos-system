## üîß Step-by-Step Setup Process

### Step 1: Identify Your Physical Printers

First, gather information about your actual printers:

**For each printer, note:**
- **IP Address** (e.g., 192.168.1.150)
- **Port Number** (usually 9100 for most receipt printers)
- **Printer Model** 
- **Location** (which kitchen station it's located at)

### Step 2: Find Printer IP Addresses

**Method A: Check Printer Display/Menu**
1. Most receipt printers have a menu button
2. Navigate to Network Settings or TCP/IP Settings
3. Note down the IP address shown

**Method B: Print Network Configuration**
1. Many printers can print a network status page
2. Hold down the feed button while turning on the printer
3. Look for IP address on the printed page

**Method C: Check Your Router/Network Admin Panel**
1. Log into your router's admin interface
2. Look for "Connected Devices" or "DHCP Client List"
3. Identify printers by their MAC addresses or names

### Step 3: Configure Printer IP Addresses in POS System

1. **Open POS System**
   - Start your POS application
   - Look for the printer icon (üñ®Ô∏è) in the top navigation bar

2. **Access IP Configuration**
   - Click the printer icon
   - Select **"Configure IP Addresses"** from the dropdown menu
   - The IP Configuration dialog will open

3. **Enter Real Printer Information**
   For each printer station:
   - **Replace the default IP** with your actual printer's IP address
   - **Verify the port** (usually 9100)
   - **Update the model name** to match your actual printer

   **Example Configuration:**
   ```
   Main Kitchen Printer: 192.168.1.150:9100  (Your actual main printer)
   Tandoor Station:      192.168.1.151:9100  (Printer near tandoor)
   Curry Station:        192.168.1.152:9100  (Printer at curry station)
   Appetizer Station:    192.168.1.153:9100  (Printer for cold prep)
   Grill Station:        192.168.1.154:9100  (Printer at grill area)
   Bar/Beverage:         192.168.1.155:9100  (Printer at bar)
   ```

4. **Test Connections**
   - Click **"Test Connections"** button
   - Wait for the system to test each printer
   - ‚úÖ Green = Online and working
   - ‚ùå Red = Not reachable (check IP/network)

5. **Save Configuration**
   - Once all printers show green (online), click **"Save Configuration"**
   - You'll see a success message

### Step 4: Assign Menu Categories to Printers

After configuring IP addresses, assign your menu items to the appropriate printers:

1. **Navigate to Printer Assignments**
   - Go to **Admin Panel** ‚Üí **Printer Assignments**
   - Or click printer icon ‚Üí **"Printer Assignments"**

2. **Drag and Drop Assignment**
   - **Left Side**: Your configured printer stations
   - **Right Side**: Menu categories and items
   - **Drag categories** from right to left printer zones

   **Recommended Assignments:**
   ```
   Tandoor Station ‚Üê Tandoori items, Naan, Kebabs
   Curry Station ‚Üê Curry dishes, Dal, Rice dishes  
   Appetizer Station ‚Üê Starters, Salads, Cold items

   - Example: "Chicken Tikka" ‚Üí Both Tandoor Station AND Main Kitchen

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Printer Not Connecting
**Symptoms**: Red "Offline" status in test results

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Network Connection**
   - Ensure printer is connected to same WiFi network
   - Check if printer IP is reachable: `ping 192.168.1.XXX`

2. **Verify IP Address**
   - Double-check the IP address on printer display
   - Make sure no typos in POS configuration

3. **Check Port Number**
   - Most receipt printers use port 9100
   - Some use 515 (LPR) or 631 (IPP)
   - Try different ports if 9100 doesn't work

4. **Firewall Issues**
   - Ensure firewall allows printer communication
   - Check if printer ports are blocked

### Orders Not Printing to Correct Station
**Symptoms**: Orders going to wrong printer or not printing

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Category Assignments**
   - Verify menu categories are assigned to correct printers
   - Use drag-and-drop interface to fix assignments

2. **Test with Sample Order**
   - Create a test order with known items
   - Check which printer receives each item

- [ ] You have admin access to POS system
- [ ] You know the IP address of each physical printer
- [ ] All printers are on the same network as POS system
- [ ] You have a plan for which printer goes to which station

## üéØ Quick Configuration Example

**Scenario**: You have 3 physical printers

**Step 1**: Note your actual printer IPs
- Kitchen Printer A: 192.168.1.200
- Kitchen Printer B: 192.168.1.201  
- Bar Printer: 192.168.1.202

**Step 2**: Configure in POS
- Main Kitchen Printer: 192.168.1.200:9100
- Curry Station: 192.168.1.201:9100
- Bar/Beverage Station: 192.168.1.202:9100
- Set unused stations to same IPs or disable them

**Step 3**: Assign Categories
- All curry items ‚Üí Curry Station (192.168.1.201)
- All drinks ‚Üí Bar/Beverage (192.168.1.202)
- Everything else ‚Üí Main Kitchen (192.168.1.200)

## ‚ö° Benefits After Setup

- **Better Organization**: Each station gets their specific items
- **Reduced Errors**: No need to manually sort printed orders
- **Real-time Status**: See which printers are online/offline

## üîÑ Making Changes Later

To modify printer assignments later:
1. Use the IP Configuration dialog to change IP addresses
2. Use the Printer Assignment drag-and-drop interface to reassign categories
3. Test connections after any changes
4. Save configuration to apply changes

Your restaurant POS system is now ready for professional kitchen printer management!
